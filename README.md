# Databases 

This project aims to develop a database from the ground up. 

We initially had to specify an Entity Relationship Diagram given a domain (E1 - first delivery). 
After that, we were entrusted with developing a Relational Diagram with a newly created domain, closely related to the initial (E2 - second delivery). 
Lastly, we had to employ the knowledge acquired so far to create a database written in PostgreSQL and with an interface written in Flask and HTML (E3 - third delivery).
